# BIGTREETECH - Pinouts, Diagrams and Notes

This is a somewhat random collection of pinouts, diagrams and other notes regarding BIGTREETECH's various hardware, as there are often not enough details in the official documentation or repositories.

Since I've gone through all of this myself and can verify that this information is valid (or was at the time of publishing, at the very least), I figured it would be useful to share this with everyone else, to avoid the same mistakes I made and any other headaches that might be caused by the lack of this information, or easy access to it.

## BTT CB1 + TFT35 SPI + Serial-over-UART

**Note:** I will add a diagram here as soon as the GitHub Pages site is up and running, as well as link to the page with more information on this.
